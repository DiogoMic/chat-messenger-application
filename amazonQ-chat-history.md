Based on the README.md file, I understand this is a comprehensive deployment guide for a **Chat Messenger Application** built on AWS. Here's what I gather:

## Project Overview
This is a modern, real-time chat application with a **serverless architecture** using React for the frontend and AWS services for the backend infrastructure.

## Architecture Components

**Frontend Stack:**
- React application hosted on S3 with CloudFront CDN distribution
- Static asset delivery optimized for performance

**Backend Stack:**
- **API Gateway** for both REST and WebSocket APIs
- **Lambda functions** for serverless compute
- **DynamoDB** for data persistence (chat messages, rooms, connections)
- **S3** for media file storage
- **AWS Cognito** for optional authentication

## Key Capabilities

**Real-time Features:**
- WebSocket-based messaging for instant communication
- Connection management with automatic cleanup via TTL
- Support for both direct and group chats

**Data Management:**
- Persistent chat history storage
- Media file uploads with signed URLs
- Efficient querying with DynamoDB GSIs

**Scalability & Performance:**
- Serverless auto-scaling
- CDN-cached static assets
- Pay-per-request billing model

## Deployment Process
The project uses environment-specific deployments (dev/staging/prod) with automated infrastructure provisioning via CloudFormation and npm scripts.

## Notable Features
- **Cost optimization** through proper resource configuration
- **Security best practices** with least-privilege IAM roles
- **Monitoring setup** with CloudWatch integration
- **Comprehensive troubleshooting guide** for common issues

This appears to be a production-ready, enterprise-grade chat application with proper AWS best practices for scalability, security, and cost management.

Now go through the file structure and explain it all, also generate a draw.io file of this application

---

I'll explore the file structure first and then create a draw.io diagram for you.

---

Now let me examine some key files to better understand the structure:

---

Let me also check the Lambda functions and services:

how do i test the frontend in my local pc

---

To test the frontend locally, follow these steps:

---



## Quick Local Testing Steps

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
cd /Users/diogo/Downloads/chat-messenger-application
npm install
```

2. **Start development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Open browser:**
- The app will run on `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port)
- Browser should open automatically

## What You'll See

The frontend currently uses **mock data** from `/src/data/mockData.ts`, so you can:
- See the chat interface with sample conversations
- Test the UI components and interactions
- Send messages (they'll be stored locally in state)
- Experience the chat layout and design

## Limitations in Local Mode

- **No real WebSocket connection** (backend not running)
- **No persistent storage** (messages reset on refresh)
- **No file uploads** (S3 not configured)
- Uses mock data instead of real chat history

## Optional: Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

This tests the optimized production build locally before deployment.

The app is designed to work offline with mock data for frontend development, so you can immediately test the UI and user experience without setting up the AWS backend.

You need to install Node.js first. Here are the quickest options:

## Option 1: Install Node.js directly
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download and install the LTS version
3. Restart your terminal

## Option 2: Using Homebrew (if you have it)
```bash
brew install node
```

## Option 3: Check if Node.js is already installed
```bash
which node
node --version
```

## Verify Installation
After installing, check:
```bash
npm --version
node --version
```

Then you can run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app requires Node.js v18 or later (as specified in the README).

in the  **@aws** can you change the websocket-handler.js and api-handler.js to python and update the file structure so the python code fits in

---

I'll convert the Lambda functions to Python and update the file structure accordingly.

Now let me remove the old JavaScript files:



---

Removing the old JavaScript Lambda handler files since we've converted them to Python.

---

```shell
rm /Users/diogo/Downloads/chat-messenger-application/aws/lambda/websocket-handler.js /Users/diogo/Downloads/chat-messenger-application/aws/lambda/api-handler.js

```

---

Let me check the updated file structure:

---



Perfect! Here's what I've done to convert the Lambda functions to Python:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **New Python Files Created:**
- `aws/lambda/websocket_handler.py` - WebSocket handler in Python
- `aws/lambda/api_handler.py` - API handler in Python  
- `aws/lambda/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

### 2. **Updated CloudFormation Template:**
- Changed runtime from `nodejs18.x` to `python3.11`
- Updated handlers to `websocket_handler.lambda_handler` and `api_handler.lambda_handler`

### 3. **Updated Deployment Script:**
- Added Python virtual environment setup
- Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt -t .`
- Package Python files with boto3 dependencies
- Clean up virtual environment after deployment

### 4. **Removed Old Files:**
- Deleted `websocket-handler.js` and `api-handler.js`

## Key Python Features:
- **boto3** for AWS SDK operations
- **DynamoDB resource/table** interfaces for cleaner code
- **Exception handling** with proper error responses
- **JSON serialization** for API responses
- **Time handling** with proper timestamp conversion

## File Structure Now:
```
aws/lambda/
├── api_handler.py          # REST API handler
├── websocket_handler.py    # WebSocket handler  
└── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
```

The Python code maintains the same functionality as the original JavaScript but uses Python-native AWS SDK patterns and error handling. The deployment script now properly packages Python dependencies for Lambda deployment.

what is the function of  **@deploy.sh**

---



The `deploy.sh` script is an **automated deployment pipeline** that handles the complete end-to-end deployment of the chat messenger application to AWS. Here's what it does:

## Main Functions:

### 1. **Infrastructure Deployment**
- Deploys AWS resources using CloudFormation template
- Creates DynamoDB tables, Lambda functions, API Gateway, S3 buckets, CloudFront

### 2. **Lambda Function Updates**
- Packages Python Lambda functions with dependencies
- Updates WebSocket and API handler functions
- Handles Python virtual environment and dependency installation

### 3. **Frontend Deployment**
- Builds React application twice (initial + production with env vars)
- Uploads static files to S3 bucket
- Sets public access policy for website hosting

### 4. **Configuration Management**
- Extracts AWS resource URLs from CloudFormation outputs
- Creates environment variables file for frontend
- Configures frontend to connect to backend services

### 5. **CDN Cache Management**
- Invalidates CloudFront cache to serve updated content
- Ensures users get the latest version immediately

## Usage:
```bash
# Deploy to dev environment
./deployment/deploy.sh dev

# Deploy to production in specific region
./deployment/deploy.sh prod us-west-2
```

## Key Benefits:
- **One-command deployment** - entire application deployed with single script
- **Environment-specific** - supports dev/staging/prod environments
- **Automated configuration** - connects frontend to backend automatically
- **Zero-downtime updates** - updates Lambda code without infrastructure changes
- **Cache invalidation** - ensures immediate content updates

The script essentially transforms your local code into a fully functional, production-ready chat application running on AWS infrastructure.
